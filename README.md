- Profit from the game

## Tools

### Game Engine
- Godot Version 3.4.4 : https://godotengine.org/download

### Project Board
- Github Projects: https://github.com/orgs/SummerGameProject/projects/1/views/1

### Art
- Pix2d (free): https://pix2d.com/
- Aseprite ($19.99): https://www.aseprite.org/
- Whatever works for you 

## Work Flow
- Create a new branch anytime you are adding anything to the game. Request a pull form someone you believe would be a good QA for the pull. Creating a new branch ensures we are making a sandbox environment where you can experiment with new ideas.
- Claim any of the tasks on the project board that belong to you and place them in the to-do or done pile. This helps us keep track of what everyone is working on so we don't have three people working on three different pause menus.
