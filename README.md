# SummerGame
Still in the works on coming uop with game ideas

## Goals
- Make and publish a finished game by mid August 
- Have an enjoyable process working on the game
- Bring something new and unquie to the games market
- Work effectively as a team though communication and understanding
- Profit from the game

## Tools

### Game Engine
- Godot Version 3.4.4 : https://godotengine.org/download

### Automated Project Board
- Github Projects: https://github.com/SummerGameProject/SummerGame/projects
- I've set up the github project board to automatically close issues if you include the issue in your pull request. E.g: "fixes #5" will close issue 5 and put it in the closed column. You have to use the word "fixes" in your pull request to send the issue to the closed column. Here's a video explaing it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff5cBkPg-bQ
- Here's a video about github issues in general https://youtu.be/TKJ4RdhyB5Y


### Art
- Pix2d (free): https://pix2d.com/
- Aseprite ($19.99): https://www.aseprite.org/
- Whatever works for you 

## Work Flow
- Create a new branch anytime you are adding anything to the game. Request a pull form someone you believe would be a good QA for the pull. Creating a new branch ensures we are making a sandbox environment where you can experiment with new ideas.
- Claim any of the tasks on the project board that belong to you and place them in the to-do or done pile. This helps us keep track of what everyone is working on so we don't have three people working on three different pause menus.
