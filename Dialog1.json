Dog is super loyal though so he might even try to find me through the woods. His nose is pretty amazing too, it seems like he can almost see my scent and track me down. I keep replacing my socks because i've been having anxity about athletes foot. I managed to lose two socks so far. I'm trying to make it to the watch tower off in the distance. I think someone might be in it, I keep seeing some movement in there."},]
