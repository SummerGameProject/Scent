I've heard some reports about a monster being spotted at the camp grounds, but I don't think it's anything but people looking for some news time. I'm taking Dog as well to spend more time with him outside. He's been pretty sleepy lately so I'll probably do some hiking in the morning and come back later to hangout with him at the camp ground. I hope you guys are enjoying your trip in Mexico City!"},
